# 🌤️ Weather Info App

This Python script allows users to check real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app is interactive, beginner-friendly, and demonstrates the use of API requests, JSON handling, and user input validation — all without the use of `.strip()` or `try/except`.
