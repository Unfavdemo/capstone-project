# 🌤️ Weather Info App

A **Python terminal application** that provides real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project demonstrates practical application of APIs, JSON handling, and user-focused design while adhering to clean code and PEP 8 standards.

---

## 🧭 Purpose / Problem Statement

Weather data is essential for daily planning, travel, and decision-making, yet many solutions are bloated, complex, or overloaded with features. This app solves the problem by delivering a **lightweight, customizable, and beginner-friendly tool** to check specific weather metrics in any city — right from the terminal.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Students** needing weather information before school or travel
- **Young adults and travelers** checking conditions in unfamiliar cities
- **Beginner Python developers** looking for a clean example of API usage and structured programming

---

## ✅ Solution + 🚫 Limitations

### ✅ Solution
- Prompts the user to enter a city name and select the weather details they want.
- Makes a real-time request to the OpenWeatherMap API and parses the JSON response.
- Displays only the selected weather details for a clean and efficient user experience.

### 🚫 Limitations
- Only supports one city lookup at a time.
- Requires a valid internet connection and API key (no offline mode).
- Limited to current weather data (no hourly/extended forecast).
- Supports temperature in Celsius only (Fahrenheit coming soon).

---

## 🧩 Key Features / Components

```python
# Example: Fetching and parsing JSON from OpenWeatherMap
response = requests.get(api_url)
data = response.json()
temperature = data['main']['temp']
description = data['weather'][0]['description']
```

- 🔍 **City-based search**: Users can input any global city name.
- 📋 **Selective output**: Choose from:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Weather description
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - All available data
- 📦 **Structured JSON parsing**: Efficient dictionary lookups
- ✅ **Clean terminal interface**: Easy-to-read, uncluttered output
- 🧠 **Input validation without `try/except`**: Custom logic to ensure valid menu selections and non-empty city input

---

## 🧪 Technical Challenges + Future Plans

### 🧪 Challenges Faced
- **Input validation** without using `try/except`: Required carefully planned conditional logic to reject empty or numeric-only city names.
- **Error-free JSON access**: Ensuring safe access to nested values in the response without relying on exception catching.

### 🛠️ Future Plans
- Add **Fahrenheit support** with unit toggle
- Display **weather icons** using the API’s icon URL
- Implement a **5-day forecast view**
- Introduce a **GUI version** using `Tkinter` or `PyQt`
- Improve **robust error handling** (e.g. rate limits, malformed inputs)

## 🗓️ Project Timeline

| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| 1–2 | Researched API usage and parsed JSON structure |
| 3   | Wrote core functionality to request and print weather data |
| 4   | Built input menus and logic to customize weather output |
| 5   | Conducted manual testing with various edge cases |
| 6   | Optimized code for readability and performance |
| 7   | Wrote full README and cleaned up documentation |

## 📎 Example Output

```
Welcome to the Weather Info App!
Enter a city name: London

What would you like to see?
1. Weather description
2. Temperature (°C)
3. Humidity
4. Wind speed
5. All of the above
Choice: 5

🌤️ Weather in London:
- Description: scattered clouds
- Temperature: 16.8°C
- Humidity: 65%
- Wind Speed: 3.4 m/s
```

---

## 🧼 Code Quality Notes

- Follows **PEP 8** style guide (naming, spacing, comments)
- Includes **docstrings** for all user-defined functions
- Structured for **modular readability**
- Designed for **beginner accessibility**, but demonstrates intermediate Python techniques such as dictionary manipulation, API integration, and terminal UI design
